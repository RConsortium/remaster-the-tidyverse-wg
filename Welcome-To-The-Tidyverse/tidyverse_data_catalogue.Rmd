## Slide Example Data

### Example 1 / Slide 6 / Your Turn 1

"Your Turn 1" uses the mpg data and plots `displ` vs `hwy`.

```{r}
head(mpg)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Example uses mpg data, displ (continuous), hwy (continuous)

-   mpg data of vehicle fuel efficiency

-   `displ` is continuous

-   `hwy` is continuous

Aim is to show relationship between two continuous variables in a quick EDA plot and describe different elements of the `ggplot` and `geom_point` functions including `mapping` and `aes`.
